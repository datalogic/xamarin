**Version 1.5.88** of the SDK and **version 1.2.15** of the self-shopping extension are now available for download. Follow the directions on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/quick-start">Quick Start</a> page to get started. You can also download directly from <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/datalogic-xamarin-sdk/1.5.88">NuGet here</a> and <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/datalogic-xamarin-sdk-selfshopping/1.2.15">here</a>.
